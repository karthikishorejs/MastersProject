# Hazardous Waste Finder: Hazardous Waste Tracking Management System
Hazardous waste is a waste that is considered substantially harmful to health and environment.  Hazardous waste includes explosives, compressed gas, poisons, oxidizers, corrosives, flammable solids/liquids, radioactive materials etc.  It is important that hazardous waste needs to be recycled in a timely manner. Hazardous waste management comprises of three stages namely treatment, storage and disposal. Tracking the waste is a fundamental requirement at every stage in waste management. In this project, I developed an android mobile application - Hazardous Waste Tracker (HWT) using a hybrid mobile application Phonegap framework. HWT allows an inspector to conduct a weekly assessment about the type of hazardous waste collected and the recycled rate from an inspection site.  The benefit of this project is to effectively manage time and manpower by eliminating the traditional use of paper reports used for tracking.
